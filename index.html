      <h2>1.2 What is Frontend Web Development?</h2>
      <p><strong>Frontend web development</strong></p>
      <p>Frontend web development is about creating the part of a website that users see and interact with. It uses three main technologies ‚Äî HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

      <h3>The Trio of Frontend</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> ‚Äì gives structure to a webpage (like a skeleton).</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> ‚Äì adds color and design (like clothes).</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> ‚Äì adds movement and interactivity (like actions).</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Example</h3>
     <p>A simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù webpage uses:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML</strong> to display the text</li>
      <li><strong>CSS</strong> to color it</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> to show a popup message</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>üß† What I Learned</h3>
     <p>I learned that HTML builds the structure, CSS adds style, and JavaScript makes the webpage interactive. These three together create the complete frontend experience for users.</p>

      <h2>1.10 Introduction to HTML</h2>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned about <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong>, which is the basic structure of every webpage.</p>
      <h3>Learning Goals üéØ</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the basics of HTML</li>
        <li>Learn the anatomy of an HTML element</li>
        <li>Understand the structure of an HTML document</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>HTML defines how content is displayed on web pages. <br><br>
      <strong>HyperText</strong> means the text can contain links (hyperlinks).  
      <strong>Markup Language</strong> means using tags to format and structure content.
      </p>

      <h3>Example of an HTML Tag</h3>
      <p>Tags are written inside angle brackets and mostly come in pairs like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;You are a Super Cool Developer!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>This tag displays text as a paragraph on the webpage.</p>

      <h3>Self-Closing Tags</h3>
      <p>Some tags don‚Äôt need a closing tag. For example:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;br&gt;   <!-- line break -->
      &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image"&gt;</code></pre>

      <h3>Structure of an HTML Document</h3>
      <p>This is the basic structure of any HTML page:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;My First Webpage&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my first webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
      </code></pre>

      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong> ‚Äì Defines the HTML version.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong> ‚Äì Root element that wraps the content.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;head&gt;</strong> ‚Äì Contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong> ‚Äì Holds all the visible content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What I Learned üß†</h3>
      <p>I learned that HTML provides the structure for all websites. Each element is defined by tags, and together they form a complete webpage. I also understood how an HTML document is organized using <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> sections.
      </p>

      <h2>1.11 HTML Block & Inline Elements</h2>
      <p>
      In this lesson, I learned about the difference between
      <strong>block</strong> and <strong>inline</strong> elements in HTML.
      Understanding how they behave helps in structuring and styling web pages correctly.
      </p>

      <h3>Block Elements</h3>
      <p>
      Block elements take up the entire width of the page and always start on a new line.
      Common examples include headings, paragraphs, and divs.
      </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;This is a block div&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
      Each of these starts on a new line and stretches across the page, creating a clear structure in the layout.
      </p>

      <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
      <p>Inline elements only take up as much space as needed and sit within block elements. They‚Äôre useful for styling parts of text or adding links inside a paragraph.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
      &lt;span&gt;This is a span&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;This is a link&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;This is bold&lt;/strong&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
      These stay within the same line of text ‚Äî perfect for highlighting or linking content without breaking the flow.
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Difference</h3>
      <p>
      When displayed on a webpage, block elements stack one below the other, while inline elements appear next to each other on the same line.
      </p>
      <h3>What I Learned üß†</h3>
      <p>I learned that block elements structure the layout by creating sections, while inline elements style or emphasize content within those sections.Knowing when to use each type is essential for clean and organized web design.

     <h2>1.12 HTML Lists</h2>
     <p>
     In this lesson, I learned how to use lists in HTML to organize and present information neatly. Lists make webpages more structured and easy to follow.
     </p>
     <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
     <p>
     Unordered lists are used when the order of items doesn‚Äôt matter. I can use them to show topics, tools, or collections.
     </p>
     <h4>Frontend Topics I‚Äôve Learned</h4>
     <ul>
       <li>HTML Basics</li>
       <li>CSS Styling</li>
       <li>Git and GitHub</li>
       <li>Responsive Design</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
      <p>
      Ordered lists are used when the order is important ‚Äî like steps or processes. I used them to understand how a webpage is built step by step.
      </p>

     <h4>Steps to Create a Simple Webpage</h4>
     <ol>
       <li>Create an HTML file</li>
       <li>Add structure using HTML tags</li>
       <li>Style it using CSS</li>
       <li>Add interactivity using JavaScript</li>
      </ol>

     <h3>Description Lists</h3>
     <p>
      Description lists are used to define terms and meanings. They helped me understand key web development concepts clearly.
     </p>

     <h4>Frontend Concepts Explained</h4>
     <dl>
       <dt><strong>HTML</strong></dt>
       <dd>Defines the structure and layout of a webpage.</dd>
       <dt><strong>CSS</strong></dt>
       <dd>Controls the design, colors, and visual appearance.</>
       <dt><strong>JavaScript</strong></dt>
       <dd>Adds behavior and interactivity to webpages.</dd>
     </dl>

     <h3>What I Learned üß†</h3>
     <p>
     I learned that:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for collections where order doesn‚Äôt matter.</li>
       <li><strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for steps or sequences.</li>
       <li><strong>Description lists</strong> are for explaining key terms and their meanings.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>
      Using these list types makes my webpage content cleaner and more readable.
     </p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h2>1.13 Introduction to CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls how a webpage looks. Linked to HTML, it changes colors, fonts, backgrounds, and layout. CSS separates content from style for cleaner code.</p>
   </section>

    <section id="unit-1-13">
     <h2>1.13 CSS Selectors</h2>

     <p>
     In this lesson, I learned how to use CSS selectors to style specific parts of a webpage. Selectors help target elements so each one can have a unique look.
     </p>

     <h3>What are CSS Selectors?</h3>
     <p>
      Selectors are like giving instructions to the browser about which elements to style. Without them, every element would look the same!
     </p>

     <h3>Tag Selectors</h3>
     <p>
      Tag selectors style all elements of a particular type.  
      Example: Making all headings green and all paragraphs larger.
     </p>

      <pre><code>h1 {
        color: green;
      }

      p {
        font-size: 18px;
      }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>Class Selectors</h3>
      <p>
      Class selectors style elements with a specific class attribute. This allows multiple elements to share the same
      style.
      </p>
      <pre><code>.highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>ID Selectors</h3>
      <p>
      ID selectors style a single element with a specific id attribute. This is useful for unique elements that need distinct styling.
      </p>
      <pre><code>#main-title {
        font-size: 24px;
        font-weight: bold;
      }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>Pseudo-Class Selectors</h3>
      <p>
      Pseudo-class selectors style elements based on their state or position. For example, changing link colors when hovered over.
      </p>
      <pre><code>a:hover {
        color: red;
      }</code></pre>
      <h3>What I Learned üß†</h3>
      <ul>
        </li>Tag selectors are for all elements of a type.</li>
        <li>Class selectors are for groups of elements with a common role.</li>
        <li>ID selectors are for a unique element.</li>
        <li>Pseudo-classes are for states or interactions.</li>
        <li>CSS selectors give me precise control, like a director controlling each actor on stage. Knowing how to use them lets me make web pages look exactly the way I want.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>1.15 CSS Diner | Group Activity</h2>
      <p>This was a practical activity to reinforce CSS selectors. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>In this lesson, I learned how to organize data neatly on a webpage using <strong>HTML tables</strong>.
         Tables are really useful when I want to display structured information like schedules, results, or comparison charts.
         I understood that tables help present data clearly, just like rows and columns in a spreadsheet.
      </p>
      <h3>Lesson Outcomes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand the basic tags for creating tables.</li>
        <li>Use headers to label columns and rows.</li>
        <li>Merge cells using colspan and rowspan.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Blueprint: The Table Structure</h3>
      <p>The <strong>&lt;table&gt;</strong> tag is the container for all your table content. Inside it, we use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;tr&gt;</strong> ‚Äî defines a row.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;td&gt;</strong> ‚Äî defines a cell for data.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;th&gt;</strong> ‚Äî defines a header cell for titles or labels.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example 1: A Simple Table</h3>
      <table border="2px">
        <tr>
          <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
          <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
          <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Example 2: Table with Headers</h3>
      <table border="2px">
        <tr>
          <th>Time</th>
          <th>Monday</th>
          <th>Tuesday</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9:00 AM</td>
          <td>Math</td>
          <td>Science</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10:00 AM</td>
          <td>English</td>
          <td>History</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Example 3: Table Using Colspan</h3>
      <p>Use <strong>colspan</strong> when you want one cell to stretch across multiple columns.</p>
      <table border="2px">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="3">Weekly Schedule</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Day</th>
          <th>Morning</th>
          <th>Afternoon</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Monday</td>
          <td>Math</td>
          <td>Science</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tuesday</td>
          <td>English</td>
          <td>History</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Example 4: Table Using Rowspan</h3>
      <p>Use <strong>rowspan</strong> to make a cell span multiple rows.</p>
      <table border="2px">
        <tr>
          <th>Time</th>
          <th>Activity</th>
          <th>Day</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td rowspan="2">11:00 AM</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Break</td>
          <td>Monday</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Tuesday</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>HTML tables organize data clearly. Here‚Äôs a quick recap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;table&gt;</strong> ‚Äî defines the table.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;tr&gt;</strong> ‚Äî defines each row.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;td&gt;</strong> ‚Äî defines a data cell.</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;th&gt;</strong> ‚Äî defines a header cell.</li>
        <li><strong>colspan</strong> ‚Äî merges columns.</li>
        <li><strong>rowspan</strong> ‚Äî merges rows.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>1.17 HTML Forms</h2>
      <p>
        In this topic, I learned how to collect user information on a webpage using <strong>HTML forms</strong>.
        Forms are essential when I want users to type, select, or submit any kind of data like names, colors, or feedback.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to define a form using <strong>&lt;form&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;/form&gt;</strong> tags.</li>
        <li>Different types of inputs like text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns.</li>
        <li>How to use the <strong>action</strong> attribute to send data for processing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Creating a Simple Form</h3>
      <p>
        Every form starts with a basic structure where all the input elements are placed between 
        <strong>&lt;form&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;/form&gt;</strong>.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Tag</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;form&gt;</td>
          <td>Defines the start and end of a form.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;input&gt;</td>
          <td>Creates input fields for user data.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;select&gt;</td>
          <td>Creates a dropdown list.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&lt;option&gt;</td>
          <td>Specifies options inside a dropdown.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Text Input</h3>
      <p>
        I learned that the <strong>text input</strong> allows users to enter single-line text such as names or emails.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Radio Buttons</h3>
      <p>
        Radio buttons let users select only one option from a group.
        All buttons in the same group share the same <strong>name</strong>.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <input type="radio" name="color" value="red"> Red  
            <input type="radio" name="color" value="green"> Green  
            <input type="radio" name="color" value="blue" checked> Blue
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Checkbox</h3>
      <p>
        Checkboxes allow multiple selections.
        I can preselect a checkbox using the <strong>checked</strong> attribute.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <input type="checkbox" name="interest" value="music"> Music  
            <input type="checkbox" name="interest" value="sports" checked> Sports  
            <input type="checkbox" name="interest" value="art"> Art
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Dropdown Menu</h3>
      <p>
        Dropdowns are useful when I want users to pick from a list of options.
        The selected option can be marked with <strong>selected</strong>.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <select name="color">
              <option value="red">Red</option>
              <option value="green" selected>Green</option>
              <option value="blue">Blue</option>
            </select>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Submitting the Form</h3>
      <p>
        I learned that forms send data to another page or script using the <strong>action</strong> attribute.
        The data is sent when the user clicks the <strong>Submit</strong> button.
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <form action="#">
              First name: <input type="text" name="first_name" maxlength="100"><br><br>
              Last name: <input type="text" name="last_name" maxlength="100"><br><br>
              <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            </form>

    <h2>1.18 CSS Box Model</h2>

    <p>In this part, I learned about the <strong>CSS Box Model</strong>. It helped me understand how every element on a webpage is like a box with different layers ‚Äî margin, border, padding, and content. It‚Äôs the core idea that controls spacing and layout in CSS.</p>

    <h3>What I Learned üéØ</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Every element in CSS is a box.</li>
      <li>The box has four main parts ‚Äî <strong>Content, Padding, Border, and Margin.</strong></li>
      <li>Each layer affects spacing and layout differently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Box Model Layers</h3>
    <p>Here‚Äôs how the layers are arranged:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content:</strong> The area where text or images appear.</li>
      <li><strong>Padding:</strong> Space between the content and border.</li>
      <li><strong>Border:</strong> Wraps around the padding.</li>
      <li><strong>Margin:</strong> The outermost layer creating space between elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <div style="text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">
      <img src="box+model1.png" alt="CSS Box Model Diagram" style="max-width: 90%; border-radius: 10px;">
      <p style="font-size:14px; color:#ccc;">Illustration of the CSS Box Model</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Example of Padding</h3>
    <p>I also practiced how to use padding with different values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>padding: 10px;</code> ‚Üí All sides get 10px</li>
      <li><code>padding: 10px 20px;</code> ‚Üí Top/Bottom 10px, Left/Right 20px</li>
      <li><code>padding: 5px 10px 15px 20px;</code> ‚Üí Top 5px, Right 10px, Bottom 15px, Left 20px</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>2.1 Font & Text Properties in CSS</h2>

      <p>In this lesson, I learned how CSS allows me to style text and control its appearance on a webpage. Typography is important for readability and making the page visually appealing, so understanding font and text properties is essential.</p>

     <h3>Lesson Outcomes</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Identify different CSS properties used to control font appearance (style, size, and weight).</li>
       <li>Apply CSS properties to adjust text layout (alignment, spacing, decoration).</li>
       <li>Choose appropriate font families for different contexts (serif, sans-serif, monospace).</li>
       <li>Understand the impact of typography on readability and user experience.</li>
       <li>Combine multiple text and font properties to create styled text elements.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Font Families</h3>
     <p>I learned that font families are like outfits for text. Serif fonts have small "feet" (e.g., Times New Roman, Georgia) and look formal. Sans-serif fonts have no feet (e.g., Arial, Helvetica) and look clean and modern. Monospace fonts (e.g., Courier New) make each letter the same width and are ideal for code.</p>
     <p>The <code>font-family</code> property lets me specify which font to use and provide fallback options. For example:</p>
     <pre><code>font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;</code></pre>

     <h3>Font Size, Weight, and Style</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>font-size</strong> ‚Äì Controls the size of text. Can use <code>px</code>, <code>em</code>, or <code>rem</code>.</li>
       <li><strong>font-weight</strong> ‚Äì Controls thickness or boldness (values: normal, bold, or 100‚Äì900).</li>
       <li><strong>font-style</strong> ‚Äì Controls slanting: <code>normal</code>, <code>italic</code>, or <code>oblique</code>.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Text Properties</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>text-align</strong> ‚Äì Align text: left, right, center, or justify.</li>
       <li><strong>text-decoration</strong> ‚Äì Add/remove lines: none, underline, overline, line-through.</li>
       <li><strong>line-height</strong> ‚Äì Space between lines (e.g., 1.5 for readability).</li>
      <li><strong>text-transform</strong> ‚Äì Change capitalization: uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, none.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Example: Styling a Promo Box</h3>
     <p>I practiced combining font and text properties using the following HTML structure:</p>
     <pre><code>&lt;div class="promo-box"&gt;
     &lt;h2&gt;Special Offer!&lt;/h2&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Limited time discount on all items.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;a href="#"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt; 
     &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
     <p>Using CSS, I could:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Make the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> text centered, bold, and uppercase.</li>
       <li>Give the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> text a comfortable line height (e.g., 1.5).</li>
        <li>Style the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link to be blue and remove the underline.</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>What I Learned üß†</h3>
    <p>I learned how to choose the right "outfit" for my text with font-family, adjust the "fit" using font-size, font-weight, and font-style, and arrange text neatly using text-align, text-decoration, line-height, and text-transform. These properties give me full control over how text looks and improves the readability and overall design of my webpages.</p>

       <h2>2.2 CSS Inheritance</h2>
 
       <p>In this lesson, I learned about CSS inheritance, which allows child elements to inherit certain property values from their parent elements. Understanding inheritance helps me write cleaner and more efficient CSS.</p>

       <h3>What I Learned</h3>
       <p>Inheritance in CSS works similarly to how children inherit traits from their parents. For example, if I set a property on a parent element, its child elements may inherit that property automatically.</p>

       <h3>Example</h3>
       <p>HTML:</p>
       <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;I am a &lt;strong&gt;KALVIAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
       <p>CSS:</p>
       <pre><code>p {
        color: red;
        }
        strong {
        font-size: 16px;
       }</code></pre>
       <p>Result: The entire sentence appears red because the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag inherits the <code>color: red;</code> property from its parent <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element.</p>

       <h3>Important Notes</h3>
       <ul>
          <li>Not all CSS properties are inherited. For example, <code>border</code> is not inherited by default.</li>
         <li>Commonly inherited properties include: <code>color</code>, <code>direction</code>, <code>font-family</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>font-style</code>, <code>font-weight</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>text-align</code>, and several others.</li>
         <li>Understanding which properties inherit helps avoid unintended styles on child elements.</li>
         </ul>
 
       <h3>Practice</h3>
       <p>I practiced CSS inheritance using a web playground like Stackblitz to see how properties propagate from parent to child elements and which properties are not inherited.</p>

       h3>Summary üóíÔ∏è</h3>
       <p>In this lesson, I learned the concept of CSS inheritance, how child elements inherit certain properties from their parent elements, and the importance of knowing which properties are inheritable to write efficient CSS.</p>

       <h2>2.3 CSS Positioning</h2>

        <p>In this lesson, I learned how to control the exact placement of elements on a webpage using CSS positioning. Instead of letting the browser decide the layout, I can now place elements exactly where I want.</p>

       <h3>CSS Positioning Types</h3>

       <h4>1. Static (default)</h4>
       <p>By default, every element has <code>position: static;</code>. Elements appear in the order they are written in HTML, from top to bottom. You cannot move them using top, bottom, left, or right.</p>

       <h4>2. Relative</h4>
       <p>With <code>position: relative;</code>, elements stay in their normal flow but can be nudged using <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code>.</p>
       <div class="relative-box">Relative Box</div>

       <h4>3. Absolute</h4>
       <p>Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal flow. It is positioned relative to the nearest parent with a position other than static. If no parent is positioned, it will use the browser window as reference.</p>
       <div class="container">
        Container
        <div class="absolute-box">Absolute Box</div>
       </div>

       <h4>4. Fixed</h4>
       <p>Fixed elements stay in place relative to the browser viewport. They do not move when the page scrolls.</p>
       <div class="fixed-box">Fixed Box</div>

       <h4>5. Sticky</h4>
       <p>Sticky elements act like relative until they reach a scroll threshold, then they stick like fixed.</p>
       <div class="sticky-box">Sticky Box</div>
        <p>Scroll down to see sticky in action.</p>

       <h3>Z-Index</h3>
       <p>Z-index controls which overlapping elements appear in front. Only works on positioned elements.</p>
       <div class="z-index-box">Box 1</div>
       <div class="z-index-box2">Box 2</div>

       <h3>Summary üóíÔ∏è</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>I learned what CSS positioning is and how it lets me control element placement.</li>
         <li>Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, and Sticky are the main types of positioning.</li>
         <li>Z-index allows control of overlapping elements by stacking order.</li>

    <em>HTML elements</em> I learned.
    </p>
    <p>
    I started by adding a <strong>header</strong> that displayed the player‚Äôs name and a short tagline.
    Then, I used <strong>section tags</strong> to separate the player‚Äôs bio and education details clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also included a <strong>figure</strong> tag to display the player‚Äôs photo along with a
    <strong>figcaption</strong> describing the image. Finally, I wrote a short paragraph about their
    achievements and projects, using inline tags like <em>&lt;strong&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> to highlight
    key details.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>1.4 Assignment ‚Äì Building a Simple Webpage</h2>
  <p>
    In this assignment, I created a <strong>recipe webpage</strong> using everything I‚Äôve learned about
    <em>HTML structure, lists, and inline elements</em>. It was a fun task where I shared one of my favorite dishes as if I were creating my own food blog.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started with a <strong>header</strong> that included the recipe name and a catchy tagline to grab attention.
    Then, I used an <strong>unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;)</strong> to display the ingredients and an
    <strong>ordered list (&lt;ol&gt;)</strong> for the step-by-step instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also added a <strong>notes section</strong> where I gave cooking tips and alternatives for certain ingredients.
    To make the recipe more visual, I used a <strong>figure</strong> tag to add a photo of the dish along with a
    <strong>figcaption</strong> describing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    For extra emphasis, I used <em>inline elements</em> like <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> and <em>&lt;em&gt;</em> to
    highlight important cooking steps and key ingredients. Finally, I included a <strong>footer</strong> with my name and
    a short signature line ‚Äî ‚ÄúRecipe created with love by Me.‚Äù

     <h2>1.5 Assignment ‚Äì CSS Selectors</h2>

  <p>
    In this assignment, I created a <strong>zoo-themed webpage</strong> using everything I‚Äôve learned about
    <em>CSS selectors, HTML structure, and styling techniques</em>. It was a fun challenge to bring the digital zoo to life!
  </p>

  <p>
    I started by creating <strong>four animal cards</strong> for lions, penguins, flamingos, and elephants. 
    I organized the page using semantic <strong>sections</strong> and headings to make the layout clear and readable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, I applied different <strong>CSS selectors</strong> to style each part of the webpage:
    <ul>
      <li>Used the <strong>universal selector (*)</strong> to reset margin, padding, and box-sizing for consistency.</li>
      <li>Applied <strong>tag selectors</strong> to style all <code>h2</code> and <code>h3</code> headings with colors, spacing, and uppercase text.</li>
      <li>Used <strong>class selectors</strong> like <code>.carnivore</code> to give a red badge, bold font, and background to carnivorous animals.</li>
      <li>Used <strong>ID selectors</strong> like <code>#elephant</code> to give a unique layout, padding, and a gray theme.</li>
      <li>Used <strong>pseudo-class selectors</strong> like <code>:first-child</code> to give the first animal card a spotlight effect and <code>:hover</code> to animate links and card backgrounds.</li>
      <li>Used <strong>descendant selectors</strong> to style fun facts lists inside each card.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    I also made sure to add <strong>visual effects</strong> such as shadows, spacing, and hover animations to make the zoo cards interactive
    and engaging for users. The final page looked organized, colorful, and professional while following best practices for HTML and CSS.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this assignment, I learned how to combine different selectors efficiently, structure content using semantic HTML,
    and use CSS to make webpages visually appealing. It strengthened my understanding of styling and selector hierarchy in a real project.

    <h2>1.6 Assignment ‚Äì Time Table</h2>

  <p>
    In this assignment, I created a <strong>weekly timetable webpage</strong> using <em>HTML tables</em> to organize daily activities
    from Monday to Friday. It was a fun task where I planned study sessions, workouts, breaks, and even some Netflix time!
  </p>

  <p>
    I started by creating a <strong>table structure</strong> using <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> tags. 
    The <strong>header row</strong> clearly shows the time slots and weekdays, making the timetable easy to read.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, I filled in the <strong>main activities</strong> using table rows:
    <ul>
      <li>Used <strong>rowspan</strong> for longer activities like a 2-hour study session.</li>
      <li>Used <strong>colspan</strong> to merge cells for lunch or snack breaks.</li>
      <li>Color-coded different activities using <strong>inline styles or internal CSS</strong> for better visualization‚Äîstudy time in blue, exercise in green, Netflix time in red, and breaks in yellow.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    I also added borders to the table to make it neat and visually organized. The final timetable clearly shows
    when each activity happens, making it easy for anyone to follow and plan their day effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this assignment, I learned how to structure tables properly using rowspan and colspan, 
    and how to use CSS to make tabular data visually appealing. It helped me understand both <strong>HTML table semantics</strong> and <strong>color coding for clarity</strong>.

     <h2>1.7 Assignment ‚Äì Building a Survey Form</h2>

  <p>
    In this assignment, I created a <strong>survey form webpage</strong> using <em>HTML form elements</em> to collect feedback from my squad.
    It was an engaging task where I applied my UX skills to make the form clean, organized, and user-friendly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started by wrapping the entire form inside the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag. Then, I added 
    <strong>text fields</strong> for basic user information like name and email, using the <code>placeholder</code> attribute 
    to guide users.
  </p>

  <p>
    For interactive questions:
    <ul>
      <li>I implemented <strong>radio buttons</strong> for questions that required only one choice, grouping them with the same <code>name</code> attribute.</li>
      <li>I added <strong>checkboxes</strong> for questions that allowed multiple selections.</li>
      <li>I included a <strong>dropdown menu</strong> for options like preferred communication method.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    To make the form functional and accessible:
    <ul>
      <li>All required fields, like name and email, were marked as <code>required</code> to ensure proper input.</li>
      <li>I used <strong>&lt;label&gt;</strong> tags for all form elements, enhancing usability and accessibility.</li>
      <li>A <code>submit</code> button was included to send the form data.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    I also applied <strong>internal CSS</strong> to style the form, making it visually appealing and responsive for mobile devices. 
    Grouped related elements logically, used spacing and borders for clarity, and ensured colors and fonts improved readability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this assignment, I learned how to combine <strong>form structure, UX principles, and CSS styling</strong> to build a professional and accessible survey form. 
    It enhanced my understanding of user-friendly design and responsive layouts.
