    <section>
      <h2>1.1 Course Overview & Orientation</h2>
      <p>This lesson provides an introduction to the course, explaining the roadmap, objectives, and learning outcomes. It helps students understand what frontend development entails and how the modules are structured.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.2 What is Frontend web development?</h2>
      <p>Frontend development is about creating the user interface of a website ‚Äî what users see and interact with. HTML defines structure, CSS defines style, and JavaScript defines behavior. This lesson explains how these technologies work together.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.3 Building a Hobbies Webpage</h2>
      <p>In this topic, I learned to create my first simple webpage showcasing my hobbies. I practiced using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images, understanding how browsers render HTML content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.4 Setting up development environment - I</h2>
      <p>This lesson covers setting up tools to write and test code efficiently. Key learning: installing Visual Studio Code, organizing project folders, and introduction to GitHub for version control.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.5 Setting up development environment - II</h2>
      <p>Continuation of environment setup with focus on enhancing productivity. Installing VS Code extensions like Live Server and Prettier, learning code formatting and shortcuts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.6 Introduction to Git & Github - I</h2>
      <p>This topic introduces Git, a version control system, and GitHub, an online repository hosting platform. Learned to initialize a Git repository, make commits, and understand version control.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.7 Introduction to Git & Github - II</h2>
      <p>Focus on connecting local Git repositories to GitHub, creating a remote repo, pushing commits, and keeping code synchronized online.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.8 Introduction to Git & Github - III</h2>
      <p>Advanced Git concepts for collaboration: branching, merging, and pull requests. These skills are crucial for team projects and professional workflows.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.9 Let's play a game with Git commands</h2>
      <p>This lesson is a practical exercise to reinforce Git commands: forking, cloning, and raising pull requests to simulate real-world collaboration.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.10 Introduction to HTML</h2>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. Learned basic structure of HTML document, common tags, and attributes. HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.11 HTML Block & Inline Elements</h2>
      <p>HTML elements are either block-level or inline. Block elements start on a new line and take full width (div, p, section), while inline elements stay within a line and take only the necessary width (span, a, strong). Understanding these helps structure content and layout.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.12 HTML Lists</h2>
      <p>Lists organize information: ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered, unordered lists (<ul>) use bullets, and description lists (<dl>) have terms (<dt>) and descriptions (<dd>). Useful for menus, steps, or repeated content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.13 Introduction to CSS</h2>
      <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls how a webpage looks. Linked to HTML, it changes colors, fonts, backgrounds, and layout. CSS separates content from style for cleaner code.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.14 Styling Elements using CSS selectors</h2>
      <p>CSS selectors target elements to apply styles. Examples: element selector (p {color: blue;}), class selector (.title {}), ID selector (#header {}). Selectors allow precise styling and customization.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.15 CSS Diner | Group Activity</h2>
      <p>This was a practical activity to reinforce CSS selectors. (Can skip in webpage if needed.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.16 HTML Tables</h2>
      <p>Tables structure data in rows and columns: table, tr, th, td. Attributes like colspan and rowspan merge cells. Tables are used for schedules, pricing charts, and data presentation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.17 HTML Forms</h2>
      <p>Forms collect user input: form wraps input elements, input types include text, email, password, checkbox, radio. Labels describe fields, textarea for multi-line input, button to submit. Forms are essential for login, feedback, and interaction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1.18 CSS Box Model</h2>
      <p>The Box Model defines spacing for each element: content, padding, border, margin. Understanding this is essential for layout design and positioning elements properly.</p>
